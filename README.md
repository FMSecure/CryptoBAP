HOL4 commit: 15e37a5df6ea4b6680e57420257ba30b2e45ceac

Branch policy:
* one branch per feature
  * commit in a feature branch must compile
  * Holmake must work
  * Can cheat
  * Code can be commented
* master is the stable release (probably 1/2 months behind the development
  * big-fix ok
  * changes that do not affect existing code ok (e.g. new theories, functions. etc)
  * should be tested (possibly using automatic tests)
  * merge to master only after pull request and 2 reviews (for now Roberto + Thomas)
  * no cheat
* development is the standard branch where completed features are merged
  * must correctly compile
  * self tests must succedes
  * merge to development 1 review (Thomas or Roberto, not the same one that developed the feature)
  * no cheat

* if you want to violate the rules for temporary development or experiments (only for feature branches)
  * fork
  * merge in feature branch after history rewrite

* suggestions
  * for long running feature branches keep in sync with base branch and rebase
  
* HOL source code
  * Spaces, no tabs
  * No unicode
  * name_surname_etc_etc
