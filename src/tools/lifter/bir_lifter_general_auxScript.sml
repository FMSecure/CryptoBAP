(* A protected if-then-else *)
(****************************)

(* For merging multiple step theorems, a top-level if-then-else is
   handy. However, one has to be careful how to use this if-then-else.
   One does not want to use it for conditional rewriting, otherwise, one
   might get aritfacts like

   ms'.REG 0 = if (ms.REG 0 = 0w) then 0w else ms.REG 0

   instead of

   ms'.REG 0 = ms.REG 0

   Moreover, one needs to be careful how to evaluate terms like

   (if c then ms1 else ms2).REG 0

   If lifting of if-then-else is used naively, there might be trouble with
   conditions in ms1 or ms2.

   After attempts with specialised rewrite rules and markers lead to very
   large and complicated code, below a new if-then-else constant is introduced.
   The simplifier does not know anything about this new constant and
   rewrite rules can distinguish between it and common if-then-else expressions
   while lifting. *)
