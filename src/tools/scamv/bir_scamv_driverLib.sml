 workflow:
 - (a) program generation
 - lifting
 - (b) obs model augmentation
 - symbolic execution
 - conversion to symbolic observation paths (n paths)
 - relation synthesis
 - (c) relation partitioning (m partitions)
 - somewhere around here: constraining memory accesses (and probably some registers or flags) for test setup
 - state generation using SMT solver
 - test execution
 - driver decision (jump to a, b or c)
