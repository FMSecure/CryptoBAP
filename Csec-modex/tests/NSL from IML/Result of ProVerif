1. The attacker has some term sigX_819.
attacker:sigX_819.

2. The attacker has some term hostX_820.
attacker:hostX_820.

3. The attacker has some term pkX_821.
attacker:pkX_821.

4. By 3, the attacker may know pkX_821.
By 2, the attacker may know hostX_820.
By 1, the attacker may know sigX_819.
Using the function 3-tuple the attacker may obtain (pkX_821,hostX_820,sigX_819).
attacker:(pkX_821,hostX_820,sigX_819).

5. The attacker has some term a_284_818.
attacker:a_284_818.

6. The attacker has some term sigX_802.
attacker:sigX_802.

7. The attacker has some term hostX_803.
