<p>This is an implementation of the verification method described in 
"Extracting and Verifying Cryptographic Models from C Protocol Code by Symbolic Execution" 
and 
"Computational Verification of C Protocol Implementations by Symbolic Execution" 
by Mihhail Aizatulin, Andy Gordon, and Jan JÃ¼rjens.</p>

<p>The distribution includes the source code of the protocols analysed in the papers: CSur,
simple mac, simple xor, RPC, RPC-enc, and NSL. Unfortunately, we are not able to distribute the source code 
of the metering protocol, due to licensing restrictions.</p>

<p>The ProVerif verification tool is being rewritten and is not currently functional.</p>

<h1>Download</h1>

<pre><code>git clone git://github.com/tari3x/csec-modex.git
</code></pre>

<p>Do not use the zip file provided by github, as it breaks symbolic links.</p>

<h1>Dependencies</h1>

<p>The distribution bundles and automatically builds most of the dependencies, 
except for the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>gcc, ocaml, cmake, openssl, polarssl, markdown</p></li>
<li><p>Yices SMT solver, which we are not allowed to redistribute due to licensing restrictions. </p>

<p>The tools are known to work with version 1.0.28/1.0.29 with dynamically linked GMP which you can obtain from
  http://yices.csl.sri.com/</p>

<p>First make sure that the appropriate version of GMP (static or dynamic, as used by yices) is installed.
You can then use the script
  deps/ocamlyices/install-yices.sh
to install yices.</p></li>
<li><p>camlidl. You can get it with opam by running "opam install camlidl".</p></li>
<li><p>the curses library (libncurses-devel in Cygwin), which is required by CIL</p></li>
</ul>

<h1>How to use</h1>

<p>The distribution relies on a unix environment and cmake for building. 
To build all the bundled dependencies and tools install cmake and run</p>

<pre><code>./build.sh
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can go into each subdirectory of the tests/ directory and run verification via</p>

<pre><code>make -f Makefile.csec
</code></pre>
